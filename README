PREREQUISITES
-------------

In order to compile and add your functions to the lib, 2 rules MUST be respected :

1/ Functions must be written as part of the go main packages.
2/ Only ucfirst named function will be exported in the library (like go-style for exported function in a package).

HOW TO BUILD LIB
----------------

just type `make` and any ucfirst named function in any go file (except pg_cgo.go) will be added to the lib.
