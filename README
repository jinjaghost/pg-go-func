NOTE
----

Since pg abandoned the V0 C functions calling convention in 2018 (https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/attachment/58498/0001-Remove-left-over-fmgr-declaration.patch), it's now hard to build stored procedure using the C API from a non-C language.
The following repo is a helper based on https://gitlab.com/microo8/plgo to easily create stored procedures in golang.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

In order to compile and add your functions to the lib, 2 rules MUST be respected :

1/ Functions must be written as part of the go main packages.
2/ Only ucfirst named function will be exported in the library (like go-style for exported function in a package).

HOW TO BUILD LIB
----------------

just type `make` and any ucfirst named function in any go file (except pg_cgo.go) will be added to the lib.
