NOTICE

Since PostgreSQL removed the V0 C functions calling convention in 2018 (refer to https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/attachment/58498/0001-Remove-left-over-fmgr-declaration.patch), building stored procedures using the C API from a non-C language has become challenging. The following repository serves as a helper, derived from https://gitlab.com/microo8/plgo, to facilitate the creation of stored procedures in Golang.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

To successfully compile and add your functions to the library, two rules MUST be adhered to:

1) Functions must be written as part of the Go main packages.
2) Only functions with names starting with an uppercase letter (following the Go-style convention for exported functions in a package) will be exported in the library.

HOW TO BUILD THE LIBRARY
------------------------
Simply execute the command make, and any function with an uppercase starting letter in any Go file (excluding pg_cgo.go) will be incorporated into the library.

CREDIT

Credit goes to https://gitlab.com/microo8/plgo for the majority of the work.
